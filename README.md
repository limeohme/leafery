# Leafery - The Notepad App

## Description
While we were doing our projects at Telerik Academy, I found it helpful to both take notes and draw schemes of the apps while I planned different features: I had to switch between different tools to achieve a complete plan for the project and that gave me the idea for an app that integrates all of the functionalities I needed. The basic features that Leafery includes (will include üòÅ) are a text editor, Excalidraw plugin, system for categorization of the Leaves (Notes/Posts/Whatever-You-Wanna-Call-Them).
I am also planning a part of it that will focus on collaboration but this idea will wait until the app has a stable basis.

## Installation
If you want to test the project download it as a zip file, go to the folder, containing the package.json file and run npm install to install all the dependencies our project needs to become fully functional (that is, if you already have Node.js installed).
After this, you can run the npm start script to start the application in the browser.
